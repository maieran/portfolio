<h3>My Backend Engineer Path</h3>
    <p> 
        Since my entrance to computer science my mother tongue in programm has become Java.<br/>
        Practicing since then in different technologies and evolving into other fields of computational systems, 
        I have come across during my working student times to .NET and C#. 
        Other courses such as DSAM AND SOA helped me to solidify my skills and thinking in terms of services and middleware.
